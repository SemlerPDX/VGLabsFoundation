VGLabsFoundation is a common functions library providing VG Labs Apps with support for updates, custom exception handling with errors logging, and more.

This repo is an example, and will not immediately work without providing a direct link in Acquisition.cs to a database.json file containing appropriate application data on a secure website.  See example json for expected structure format.  The project including this library must also contain the example AppUpdate class, tailored as needed to the app.  These provided examples are from my MouseMasterVR app.
